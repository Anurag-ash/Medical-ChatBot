Processed raw PDFs into a FAISS vector database using Hugging Face embeddings for efficient document retrieval and integrated Mistral-7B-Instruct via LangChainâ€™s RetrievalQA with a custom prompt template to ensure clinically relevant responses. Designed an intuitive Streamlit-based UI for seamless interaction, enabling users to query complex medical topics with reliable, context-aware answers.
